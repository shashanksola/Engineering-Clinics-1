If you are into IoT, robotics, or automation, then there are good chances that you must have heard about the latest revelation from the Raspberry Pi foundation, i.e. the Pi Pico. If not, then allow me to introduce you the microcontroller board, YES, you read it right, A Microcontroller!!! Pi Pico is the first microcontroller from the manufacturers of Raspberry Pi, based on the Raspberry Pi’s RP2040 microcontroller chip and working on ARM’s Dual-core cortex M0+ architecture. It works at frequencies up to 133MHz and albeit looking powerless when compared to the other members of the Pi family it has a lot to offer. Unlike the other Pi boards which are basically a Linux based single board computer, Pico is a budget friendly microcontroller with 264kB multi-bank high-performance SRAM, 16 kb of on-chip cache, and 2MB of flash storage. It is actually an amazing board considering how affordable this board is, priced at just USD 4 (around INR 300 in Indian market) it is competing directly against the likes of established Arduino boards, blowing them out of water in terms of power and speed when competed against the similarly priced modules.
